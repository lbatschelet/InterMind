This app invites you to take part in a one-week study by answering a few short questions about your current well-being and surroundings — three times a day.

Your responses will help us better understand how people experience different places — and how these experiences relate to different life situations.', '{}');

('about_this_study', 'en', 'What is this study about?', 'How we feel in a place is strongly influenced by our surroundings. Some places feel calming, familiar or welcoming. Others can make us feel uneasy, exposed or out of place.

But these experiences are not the same for everyone. They may depend on how we are perceived and treated in a space – for example, based on gender, origin, language, appearance or other characteristics that shape our position in society.

## What Do We Mean by Well-being?

Well-being can mean many things. Sometimes it refers to something long-term – for example, how satisfied we are with our life overall, how healthy we feel, or whether we feel safe and supported in everyday life.

In this study, however, we are primarily interested in **momentary well-being**: How do you feel **right now**, in this place, in this situation?

We understand well-being in a holistic way – it includes both **physical** states (e.g. fatigue, warmth, calm) and **emotional** experiences (e.g. satisfaction, safety, belonging). These short-term impressions are often fleeting and strongly influenced by where we are, what we are doing, and how we are perceived there.

## What Is the Goal?

We want to understand how such characteristics – individually or in combination – influence well-being. For example: Does a young woman with a migration background experience a public space differently than an older man at the same time in the same place?

This study aims to explore why places can feel different for different people. It looks at how feelings of belonging, safety or discomfort arise – and how these are connected to everyday experiences, social dynamics and personal life circumstances.

By participating, you help us better understand which places are experienced as supportive or burdensome – and what can contribute to more well-being in everyday urban life.

## How Does It Work?

The study runs for one week. During that time, you’ll be asked to complete a short survey on your smartphone three times a day. Each time, the questions will cover:

* where you are at the moment  
* what you are doing there  
* how you are feeling  
* and whether you feel a sense of belonging or not

Each survey is available for one hour and then expires. The time slots are slightly randomised during the day, so that you don’t always respond at the same place and time.

If you miss a survey, that’s no problem – you can simply respond to the next one.', '{}');
