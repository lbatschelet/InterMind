/**
 * Clean RLS Implementation
 * -----------------------
 * This migration removes all existing policies and creates a new clean set of policies.
 * We follow these principles:
 * 1. Questions are public readable (no auth needed)
 * 2. Assessments are only accessible by the device that created them
 * 3. Answers are only accessible for assessments that belong to the device
 */
