In this app, you will answer short questions about your current well-being and your surroundings three times a day for one week.

Your answers will help us to better understand how people experience different places - and how these experiences relate to different life situations.', NULL),
       ('about_this_study', 'en', 'What is this study about?', 'How we feel in a place depends heavily on our surroundings. Some places have a calming, familiar or inviting effect. Others make us feel uneasy, marginalized or out of place.

However, these experiences are not the same for everyone. They can depend on how we are perceived and treated in a place - for example, based on gender, origin, language, appearance or other characteristics that shape our social position.

## What do we mean by wellbeing?

Wellbeing can mean many things. Sometimes it''s about something long-term - for example, how satisfied we are with our lives overall, how healthy we feel or whether we feel safe and supported in our everyday lives.

In this study, however, we are primarily interested in **momentary well-being**: How are you feeling **right now**, in this place, in this situation?

Well-being is to be understood holistically - it includes both **physical** aspects (e.g. tiredness, warmth, calm) and **psychological** sensations (e.g. satisfaction, security, a sense of belonging). These short-term impressions are often fleeting and depend heavily on where we are, what we are doing and how we are perceived there.

## Who is conducting the study?

The study is part of a Bachelor''s thesis at the Institute of Geography at the University of Bern. It is being carried out by Lukas Batschelet and supervised by Prof. Dr. Carolin Schurr and Dr. Moritz Gubler.

## What is the aim of this study?

We are interested in how various characteristics - individually or in combination - affect current well-being. For example: Does a young woman with a history of migration feel differently in a public place than an older man who is in the same place at the same time?

In the study, we are investigating the question of why places have different effects on different people. We want to better understand how belonging, security or a feeling of not belonging arise - and how these experiences are linked to everyday life, social attributions and personal circumstances.

## How does participation work?

The study lasts one week. During this time, you will be asked to complete a short survey on your smartphone three times a day. Each time it is about:

* the place you are currently in
* what you are doing there
* how you feel
* and whether you feel like you belong or are a stranger there

Each survey is available for one hour and then expires automatically. The times are distributed slightly randomly throughout the day so that answers are not always given at the same time and in the same place.

If you miss a survey, it''s no problem - you can simply take part again at the next time.', NULL),

Participation is voluntary.  
You can skip individual questions (e.g. with "No response") and end your participation at any time.  
You can also delete your data completely later in the app settings.

## What data is collected?

- Personal details (e.g. age, gender, education)
- Answers about your current state of health and location
- Location data, provided you give your consent

## How do we handle your data?

- We do not store names, email addresses or other personal contact details
- Your data is stored anonymously on a secure Supabase server in Switzerland
- No movement profiles or permanently retrievable location histories are recorded
- Your data will only be used for scientific purposes and will not be passed on to third parties
