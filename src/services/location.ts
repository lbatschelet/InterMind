/**
 * Location Service
 * ---------------
 * This service handles all location-related functionality in the app.
 * It provides a simplified and privacy-focused way to get the user's location.
 * 
 * Privacy Features:
 * ----------------
 * - Uses low accuracy mode (100-500m radius)
 * - Rounds coordinates to reduce precision
 * - Only requests location when starting an assessment
 * - No continuous tracking
 * 
 * How it works:
 * ------------
 * 1. Requests permission from the user
 * 2. Gets a single location fix
 * 3. Reduces accuracy for privacy
 * 4. Returns the approximated location
