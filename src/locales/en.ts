    title: "Privacy Policy",
    content: `**InterMind** is a research app developed as part of a Bachelor's thesis at the Institute of Geography, University of Bern. The project is supervised by Prof. Dr. Carolin Schurr and Dr. Moritz Gubler. This Privacy Policy explains what data we collect, how it is processed, and your rights as a participant.

## 1. Who Is Responsible?

The data controller is:

**Institute of Geography**  
University of Bern  
Hallerstrasse 12  
3012 Bern, Switzerland

For any questions or concerns, please contact:  
[lukas.batschelet@unibe.ch](mailto:lukas.batschelet@unibe.ch)

## 2. What Data Is Collected?

We collect the following information:

- **Demographic data**, such as age and gender identity  
- **Survey responses** about your emotions, thoughts, and surroundings  
- **Location data** (GPS) — collected **only at the moment** of each survey entry, not continuously

We do **not** collect any personally identifying information. No name, phone number, email address or similar data is recorded.

## 3. Why Do We Collect This Data?

The data is collected exclusively for **scientific research** at the Institute of Geography, University of Bern. It helps us understand how different people experience urban space and how these experiences relate to wellbeing.

Your data will **never** be used for commercial purposes.

## 4. Legal Basis

This study is conducted in accordance with the **Swiss Federal Act on Data Protection (FADP / DSG)**. All data processing is lawful, proportional, and based on informed consent.

## 5. Data Storage and Retention

Your data is:

- Stored securely on a server **currently located in Zurich, Switzerland**
- Hosted by the provider **Supabase**
- Protected through encryption and access controls
- Fully **anonymised** and cannot be linked back to you
- Retained **only as long as necessary for the research purpose**

By default, your data remains stored **until you actively delete it** via the app settings. You may delete your data at any time. Once deleted, it cannot be recovered.

The current hosting setup may be adjusted in the future (e.g. provider or server location), but any such changes will continue to comply with Swiss data protection law and ensure the same level of data security and privacy.

## 6. Who Can Access Your Data?

Your data is:

- Used **exclusively** for research purposes at the University of Bern  
- **Not shared** with third parties outside the research team  
- Fully **anonymous** and cannot be traced back to you

Future research projects may reuse anonymized data within the Institute of Geography only.

## 7. Your Rights

Under Swiss data protection law, you have the right to:

- Receive clear information about data processing  
- Revoke your consent at any time  
- Delete your data using the in-app option  
- Contact the project team with questions or concerns

Please note: Since your data is completely anonymised, we cannot retrieve or modify individual entries.

## 8. Changes to This Policy

We may update this policy to reflect changes in the research project, infrastructure, or legal requirements. Any updates will be published in the app.

**This Privacy Policy was last updated on 17 April 2025.**
